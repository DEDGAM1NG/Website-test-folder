      <div class="inner-dropdown-content">
        <p>Captain Basil Ringrose began his legendary career as a daring pirate, embarking on adventures that would make him a notorious figure in the buccaneering world...</p>
        <h4>Characterization of main character Ringrose, Human yet smart in the challenges he faced and a hated scum to spain.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Quote 1 (chapter 19 and page 155): Ringrose reported, Guayaquil's 'cacao-nut, whereof chocolate is supposed here to be best in the whole universe.' Ringrose's addiction to chocolate and riches aside, Ringrose, Dampier, and company had bigger issues…" - This quote hints at Ringrose's human side, including his love for chocolate, while also pointing out the larger challenges they faced.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Quote 2 (chapter 5 and page 37): Ringrose was hated by the Spaniards more than ever, who had now, already multiple orders out for his arrest. He looted several Spanish towns under his wealth but now he and the buccaneers are planning to drive to Caracas due to their losses." - This quote highlights the character's notoriety and the ongoing conflict with the Spanish.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Quote 3(chapter 8 and page 96): Ringrose, the only one of the expedition's seven chroniclers in the fight, did not itemize the Spaniards' weapons. Probably they had muskets, pistols, and swivel guns. Given cannons' limited range of motion and the height differential between the barques and the canoes, their tactical value was primarily psychological." - This quote delves into Ringrose's role as a chronicler and provides insights into the weaponry used in their conflicts.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Quote 4 ( chapter 3 and page 20 ): But Ringrose was not intimidated either. The buccaneers were led greatly by him. He had sailed across the Pacific Ocean, and seen wonders and horrors that most men could only dream of. He had a small but swift frigate, and a band of brave and reckless comrades. He was determined to plunder the entirety of Santa Maria before anyone had the swift thought." - This quote underlines Ringrose's leadership and determination as an adventurer.</li>

          <h3>The task of rescuing the prncess (main conflict in the book)</h3>
          <li>In the first chapter and part of the book where a couple buccaneers Ringrose Coxon and others are just here to make and steal some riches, the main conflict is the task of saving a Native Indian princess named Maria, entrusted to Captain Ringrose by her grandfather, who had witnessed her abduction by the Spanish. During Part II, they successfully rescue her from Panama and met a buccaneer named Sharp, where she had been held hostage, and Captain Ringrose adds Coxon to his crew. Now, in Part III, we reach the climax and resolution of the pirate's final raid on the Saga of Peru. Some of them are captured and taken to England, while Princess Maria falls in love with Captain Ringrose. This is depicted in Chapter 29 on page 297.</li>

          <li><strong>Epic battles in the book(side conflicts that happened in the buccaneer pillaging in the book.)</strong></li>
          <li>In Part I, the pirates seize the Spanish ship La Santísima Trinidad, laden with precious gold and silver, and conduct raids on various Panamanian coastal towns, including Portobelo, Chagres, and Chepo. Part II sees them crossing the Panama Isthmus, reaching the South Sea, and engaging in looting expeditions across islands and mainland towns like Gorgona, Guayaquil, Paita, and Trujillo using native guides like Josesto for the harsh jungles of Puna, all while contending with rival pirate groups such as Captain Davis and Captain Swan. In the climactic Part III, the pirates mount their boldest assault on Lima, the capital of Peru, battling fierce Spanish forces and local militias. Despite suffering significant losses and betrayals, they manage to escape with a substantial fortune, but their journey concludes with some of them facing a sensational trial for piracy upon their return to England.</li>
